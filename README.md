# W207_Machine_Learning
This repo contains projects I worked on for W207 - Applied Machine Learning in the UC Berkeley MIDS program.

Project 1 covers image/digit recognition (specifically with MNIST digits).

Project 2 covers topic classification from newsgroup messages.

Project 3 covers unsupervised learning in regards to poisonous mushrooms.

The final project covers a Kaggle competition - specifically, Forest Cover Type prediction.
